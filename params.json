Using an empirically plausible theory of learning I propose a class of adaptive learning algorithms that agents might use to choose a consumption rule. I show that the algorithm always has a globally asymptotically stable consumption rule, which is optimal. Additionally, I present extensions of the model to finite horizon settings, where  agents have finite lives and life-cycle income patterns. This provides a simple and parsimonious model of consumption for large agent based models.\r\n\r\nThe paper is available at <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2013.12.007>\r\n\r\nThe working paper version is available at <http://ssrn.com/abstract=2060620>\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\nHere you can find the Python scripts used to generate the simulations in my paper. They can be modified to generate the simulations of my paper with Peter Howitt \"Adaptive Consumption Behavior\" <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2013.11.003> or to simulate consumption behavior in large scale Agent-Based Macroeconomics models.\r\n\r\nScripts are included in the scripts directory.
